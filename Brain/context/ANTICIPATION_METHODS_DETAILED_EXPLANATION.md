**Purpose:** Comprehensive explanation of CloudWalk's anticipation/settlement methods based on Q1 2025 transaction data analysis

---

## **Executive Summary**

CloudWalk offers multiple settlement and anticipation methods that allow merchants to receive payments faster than standard settlement timelines. Based on Q1 2025 transaction data (R$ 19.2B TPV), **87% of CloudWalk's total payment volume involves some form of accelerated settlement**, demonstrating that instant/accelerated money access is a core merchant need, not a nice-to-have feature.

## **1. D1 Anticipation (Next-Day Settlement)**

### **1.1 Product Overview**

**D1 Anticipation** is CloudWalk's next-day settlement service, allowing merchants to receive payment for card transactions the day after the transaction occurs, rather than waiting for the standard settlement period (typically T+1 to T+30 days depending on acquirer agreements).
