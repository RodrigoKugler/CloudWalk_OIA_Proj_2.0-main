**Critical Evaluation Questions:**

### 4.1 Recommendation Validation

For each strategic recommendation (Finding #1, #2, #3), evaluate:

1. **Does the proposal make business sense?**
   - Is the strategic opportunity real?
   - Are the assumptions reasonable?
   - Does it align with CloudWalk's business model?
   - Would CloudWalk stakeholders find this valuable?

2. **Is CloudWalk already implementing this?**
   - Check if any recommendations overlap with existing CloudWalk products/initiatives
   - Identify if proposals duplicate current portfolio features
   - Note if concepts are already in market (check InfinitePay competitive analysis docs)
   - Flag "reinventing the wheel" scenarios

3. **Are recommendations realistic given CloudWalk's context?**
   - Does it leverage CloudWalk's actual competitive advantages?
   - Are timelines realistic for CloudWalk's organization size?
   - Do resource requirements match CloudWalk's capabilities?
   - Are there regulatory/operational constraints not considered?

4. **Market Feasibility:**
   - Does the competitive analysis align with market reality?
   - Are competitor assumptions accurate?
   - Does the market opportunity actually exist?
   - Are there barriers to entry not mentioned?

### 4.2 Product Portfolio Alignment Check

**Review against CloudWalk's actual products/features:**

| Recommendation | Check if CloudWalk Already Has This | Evidence/Source | Evaluation |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| InfinitePay Solo (PF segment product) | ‚òê Yes / ‚òê No / ‚òê Partial | | |
| CloudWalk Instant Suite (PIX bundle) | ‚òê Yes / ‚òê No / ‚òê Partial | | |

- Assess if the recommendation adds value or duplicates
- Recommend how to pivot if already exists

### 4.3 Strategic Alignment Validation

**Does each recommendation align with CloudWalk's stated priorities?**

| CloudWalk Priority | Finding #1 Alignment | Finding #2 Alignment | Finding #3 Alignment |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| SME Market Penetration | ‚òê Strong / ‚òê Weak / ‚òê None | ‚òê Strong / ‚òê Weak / ‚òê None | ‚òê Strong / ‚òê Weak / ‚òê None |
| Technology Leadership | ‚òê Strong / ‚òê Weak / ‚òê None | ‚òê Strong / ‚òê Weak / ‚òê None | ‚òê Strong / ‚òê Weak / ‚òê None |

## üîç STEP 5: SOURCE DATA VERIFICATION & UNSUPPORTED METRICS AUDIT

**Critical Task:** Identify all metrics, numbers, percentages, and claims that lack proper source data or citations.

### 5.1 Metrics Inventory

**Go through README.md, INSIGHTS.md, and EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md and list:**

#### Metrics WITH Source Data:
| Metric | Value | Source Document | Source Citation | Page/Line Reference |
|--------|-------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|

| | | | | |

#### Metrics WITHOUT Source Data:
| Metric | Value | Claim Location | Missing Source | Risk Level |
|--------|-------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| | | | | ‚òê High / ‚òê Medium / ‚òê Low |

### 5.2 Verification Checklist

For each metric/claim found, verify:

  - Check if formulas are correct
  
- [ ] **Is it an assumption/hypothesis?**
  - Is it clearly marked as an estimate, assumption, or benchmark?
  - Should it be flagged as requiring validation?

### 5.3 Categories of Unsupported Metrics

**Flag metrics in these categories:**

1. **External Market Data** (e.g., "PIX has 43% market share")
   - ‚úÖ Should cite: Brazilian Central Bank, industry reports, public sources
   - ‚ùå Flag if: No citation provided

2. **Competitive Intelligence** (e.g., "Mercado Pago targeting gig workers")
   - ‚úÖ Should cite: Public announcements, news articles, market research
   - ‚ùå Flag if: Presented as fact without evidence

3. **Revenue Projections** (e.g., "4.5x revenue multiplier")
   - ‚úÖ Should explain: Methodology, assumptions, industry benchmarks
   - ‚ùå Flag if: No calculation method or assumptions shown

4. **Historical/Baseline Comparisons** (e.g., "vs. last quarter")
   - ‚úÖ Should have: Actual data from previous periods or clear estimation method
   - ‚ùå Flag if: No baseline data available

5. **Industry Benchmarks** (e.g., "$952K revenue per employee - top quartile")

| **Critical** | Core finding/metric without any source | "PIX at 13% below national 22%" - no source for 22% | -2 points |
| **High** | Important claim without citation | "4.5x revenue multiplier" - no methodology | -1 point |
| **Medium** | Supporting metric missing source | "Top quartile globally" - no benchmark cited | -0.5 points |
| **Low** | Minor assumption appropriately noted | "Estimated 2-3% adoption" - clearly marked as estimate | 0 points |

### 5.5 Output Requirements

**Provide:**

1. **Complete Metrics Inventory Table:**
   - All metrics categorized by source status
